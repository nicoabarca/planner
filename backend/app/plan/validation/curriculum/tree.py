class Curriculum(BaseModel):
    """
    A specific curriculum definition, not associated to any particular student.
    This class could be represented as a graph, but it would have *a lot* of nodes (at
    least one for every possible course in the curriculum definition).
    Instead, we store a representation of the curriculum that is optimized for quickly
    building a graph for a particular (curriculum, user) pair.

    - root: The root of the curriculum tree.
    - mutiplicity: Specifies the multiplicity of each course, in credits.
        Multiplicity limits the amount of times a course can be repeated.
        For example, if course TTF010 has a multiplicity of 15 credits, and the course
        TTF010 is worth 10 credits, then taking the TTF010 course twice only accounts to
        15 total credits.
        If a course has no multiplicity, then it defaults to the amount of credits of
        the course (eg. the TTF010 example above would have a 10-credit multiplicity).
        This makes it so that by default each course only counts at most once.
        For equivalencies that have no associated credit count, the multiplicity is
        infinite (eg. multiplicity["MAJOR-L1"] = `None`).

        Additionally, multiplicity specifies which courses should be equivalent in terms
        of credit count.
        For example, if TTF010 has a multiplicity group of [TTF010, TEO200] then taking
        TTF010 or TEO200 is exactly the same, and the multiplicity is compared against
        the total of credits among both courses.
