    """A context manager for temporarily reversing a directed graph in place.

    .. deprecated:: 2.6

       This context manager is deprecated and will be removed in 3.0.
       Use ``G.reverse(copy=False) if G.is_directed() else G`` instead.

    This is a no-op for undirected graphs.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : graph
        A NetworkX graph.

    Warning
    -------
    The reversed context manager is deprecated in favor
    of G.reverse(copy=False). The view allows multiple threads to use the
    same graph without confusion while the context manager does not.
    This context manager is scheduled to be removed in version 3.0.
