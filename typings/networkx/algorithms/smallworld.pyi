"""Functions for estimating the small-world-ness of graphs.

A small world network is characterized by a small average shortest path length,
and a large clustering coefficient.

Small-worldness is commonly measured with the coefficient sigma or omega.

Both coefficients compare the average clustering coefficient and shortest path
length of a given graph against the same quantities for an equivalent random
or lattice graph.

For more information, see the Wikipedia article on small-world network [1]_.

    The small-world coefficient of a graph G is:
