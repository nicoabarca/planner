    A graph is chordal if every cycle of length at least 4 has a chord

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : graph
      A NetworkX graph.

    Returns
    -------
    chordal : bool
      True if G is a chordal graph and False otherwise.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXNotImplemented
        The algorithm does not support DiGraph, MultiGraph and MultiDiGraph.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> e = [
    ...     (1, 2),
    ...     (1, 3),
    ...     (2, 3),

    Notes
    -----
    The routine tries to go through every node following maximum cardinality
    search. It returns False when it finds that the separator for any node
    is not a clique.  Based on the algorithms in [1]_.

def find_induced_nodes(G, s, t, treewidth_bound=...): # -> set[Unknown]:
    """Returns the set of induced nodes in the path from s to t.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : graph
      A chordal NetworkX graph
    s : node
        Source node to look for induced nodes
    t : node
        Destination node to look for induced nodes
    treewidth_bound: float
        Maximum treewidth acceptable for the graph H. The search
        for induced nodes will end as soon as the treewidth_bound is exceeded.

    Returns
    -------
    induced_nodes : Set of nodes
        The set of induced nodes in the path from s to t in G

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
        The algorithm does not support DiGraph, MultiGraph and MultiDiGraph.
        If the input graph is an instance of one of these classes, a
        :exc:`NetworkXError` is raised.
        The algorithm can only be applied to chordal graphs. If the input
        graph is found to be non-chordal, a :exc:`NetworkXError` is raised.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.Graph()
    >>> G = nx.generators.classic.path_graph(10)
    >>> induced_nodes = nx.find_induced_nodes(G, 1, 9, 2)
    >>> sorted(induced_nodes)
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

    Notes
    -----
    G must be a chordal graph and (s,t) an edge that is not in G.

    If a treewidth_bound is provided, the search for induced nodes will end
    as soon as the treewidth_bound is exceeded.

    The algorithm is inspired by Algorithm 4 in [1]_.
    A formal definition of induced node can also be found on that reference.

def complete_to_chordal_graph(G): # -> tuple[Unknown, dict[Unknown, int]]:
    """Return a copy of G completed to a chordal graph

    Adds edges to a copy of G to create a chordal graph. A graph G=(V,E) is
    called chordal if for each cycle with length bigger than 3, there exist
    two non-adjacent nodes connected by an edge (called a chord).

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
        Undirected graph

    Returns
    -------
    H : NetworkX graph
        The chordal enhancement of G
    alpha : Dictionary
            The elimination ordering of nodes of G

    Notes
    -----
    There are different approaches to calculate the chordal
    enhancement of a graph. The algorithm used here is called
    MCS-M and gives at least minimal (local) triangulation of graph. Note
    that this triangulation is not necessarily a global minimum.
