VF2 Algorithm
*************

An implementation of VF2 algorithm for graph isomorphism testing.

The simplest interface to use this module is to call networkx.is_isomorphic().

Introduction
------------

The GraphMatcher and DiGraphMatcher are responsible for matching
graphs or directed graphs in a predetermined manner.  This
usually means a check for an isomorphism, though other checks
are also possible.  For example, a subgraph of one graph
can be checked for isomorphism to a second graph.

Matching is done via syntactic feasibility. It is also possible
to check for semantic feasibility. Feasibility, then, is defined
as the logical AND of the two functions.

To include a semantic check, the (Di)GraphMatcher class should be
subclassed, and the semantic_feasibility() function should be
redefined.  By default, the semantic feasibility function always
returns True.  The effect of this is that semantics are not
considered in the matching of G1 and G2.

Examples
--------

Suppose G1 and G2 are isomorphic graphs. Verification is as follows:

>>> from networkx.algorithms import isomorphism
>>> G1 = nx.path_graph(4)
>>> G2 = nx.path_graph(4)
>>> GM = isomorphism.GraphMatcher(G1, G2)
>>> GM.is_isomorphic()
True

GM.mapping stores the isomorphism mapping from G1 to G2.

>>> GM.mapping
{0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3}


Suppose G1 and G2 are isomorphic directed graphs.
Verification is as follows:

>>> G1 = nx.path_graph(4, create_using=nx.DiGraph())
>>> G2 = nx.path_graph(4, create_using=nx.DiGraph())
>>> DiGM = isomorphism.DiGraphMatcher(G1, G2)
>>> DiGM.is_isomorphic()
True

DiGM.mapping stores the isomorphism mapping from G1 to G2.

>>> DiGM.mapping
{0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3}



Subgraph Isomorphism
--------------------
Graph theory literature can be ambiguous about the meaning of the
above statement, and we seek to clarify it now.

In the VF2 literature, a mapping M is said to be a graph-subgraph
isomorphism iff M is an isomorphism between G2 and a subgraph of G1.
Thus, to say that G1 and G2 are graph-subgraph isomorphic is to say
that a subgraph of G1 is isomorphic to G2.

Other literature uses the phrase 'subgraph isomorphic' as in 'G1 does
not have a subgraph isomorphic to G2'.  Another use is as an in adverb
for isomorphic.  Thus, to say that G1 and G2 are subgraph isomorphic
is to say that a subgraph of G1 is isomorphic to G2.

Finally, the term 'subgraph' can have multiple meanings. In this
context, 'subgraph' always means a 'node-induced subgraph'. Edge-induced
subgraph isomorphisms are not directly supported, but one should be
able to perform the check by making use of nx.line_graph(). For
subgraphs which are not induced, the term 'monomorphism' is preferred
over 'isomorphism'.

Let G=(N,E) be a graph with a set of nodes N and set of edges E.

If G'=(N',E') is a subgraph, then:
    N' is a subset of N
    E' is a subset of E

If G'=(N',E') is a node-induced subgraph, then:
    N' is a subset of N
    E' is the subset of edges in E relating nodes in N'

If G'=(N',E') is an edge-induced subgraph, then:
    N' is the subset of nodes in N related by edges in E'
    E' is a subset of E

If G'=(N',E') is a monomorphism, then:
    N' is a subset of N
    E' is a subset of the set of edges in E relating nodes in N'

Note that if G' is a node-induced subgraph of G, then it is always a
subgraph monomorphism of G, but the opposite is not always true, as a
monomorphism can have fewer edges.

Notes
-----

The implementation handles both directed and undirected graphs as well
as multigraphs.

In general, the subgraph isomorphism problem is NP-complete whereas the
graph isomorphism problem is most likely not NP-complete (although no
polynomial-time algorithm is known to exist).

        The semantic feasibility function should return True if it is
        acceptable to add the candidate pair (G1_node, G2_node) to the current
        partial isomorphism mapping.   The logic should focus on semantic
        information contained in the edge data or a formalized node class.

        By acceptable, we mean that the subsequent mapping can still become a
        complete isomorphism mapping.  Thus, if adding the candidate pair
        definitely makes it so that the subsequent mapping cannot become a
        complete isomorphism mapping, then this function must return False.

        The default semantic feasibility function always returns True. The
        effect is that semantics are not considered in the matching of G1
        and G2.

        The semantic checks might differ based on the what type of test is
        being performed.  A keyword description of the test is stored in
        self.test.  Here is a quick description of the currently implemented
        tests::

          test='graph'
            Indicates that the graph matcher is looking for a graph-graph
            isomorphism.

          test='subgraph'
            Indicates that the graph matcher is looking for a subgraph-graph
            isomorphism such that a subgraph of G1 is isomorphic to G2.

          test='mono'
            Indicates that the graph matcher is looking for a subgraph-graph
            monomorphism such that a subgraph of G1 is monomorphic to G2.

        Any subclass which redefines semantic_feasibility() must maintain
        the above form to keep the match() method functional. Implementations
        should consider multigraphs.
