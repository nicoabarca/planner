def diameter(G, seed=...): # -> dict[Unknown, Unknown] | Literal[0]:
    """Returns a lower bound on the diameter of the graph G.

    The function computes a lower bound on the diameter (i.e., the maximum eccentricity)
    of a directed or undirected graph G. The procedure used varies depending on the graph
    being directed or not.

    If G is an `undirected` graph, then the function uses the `2-sweep` algorithm [1]_.
    The main idea is to pick the farthest node from a random node and return its eccentricity.

    Otherwise, if G is a `directed` graph, the function uses the `2-dSweep` algorithm [2]_,
    The procedure starts by selecting a random source node $s$ from which it performs a
    forward and a backward BFS. Let $a_1$ and $a_2$ be the farthest nodes in the forward and
    backward cases, respectively. Then, it computes the backward eccentricity of $a_1$ using
    a backward BFS and the forward eccentricity of $a_2$ using a forward BFS.
    Finally, it returns the best lower bound between the two.

    In both cases, the time complexity is linear with respect to the size of G.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

    seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)
        Indicator of random number generation state.
        See :ref:`Randomness<randomness>`.

    Returns
    -------
    d : integer
       Lower Bound on the Diameter of G

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
        If the graph is empty or
        If the graph is undirected and not connected or
        If the graph is directed and not strongly connected.
