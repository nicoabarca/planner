def dispersion(G, u=..., v=..., normalized=..., alpha=..., b=..., c=...): # -> dict[Unknown, dict[Unknown, Unknown]] | Any | int:
    r"""Calculate dispersion between `u` and `v` in `G`.

    A link between two actors (`u` and `v`) has a high dispersion when their
    mutual ties (`s` and `t`) are not well connected with each other.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : graph
        A NetworkX graph.
    u : node, optional
        The source for the dispersion score (e.g. ego node of the network).
    v : node, optional
        The target of the dispersion score if specified.
    normalized : bool
        If True (default) normalize by the embededness of the nodes (u and v).

    Returns
    -------
    nodes : dictionary
        If u (v) is specified, returns a dictionary of nodes with dispersion
        score for all "target" ("source") nodes. If neither u nor v is
        specified, returns a dictionary of dictionaries for all nodes 'u' in the
        graph with a dispersion score for each node 'v'.

    Notes
    -----
    This implementation follows Lars Backstrom and Jon Kleinberg [1]_. Typical
    usage would be to run dispersion on the ego network $G_u$ if $u$ were
    specified.  Running :func:`dispersion` with neither $u$ nor $v$ specified
    can take some time to complete.
