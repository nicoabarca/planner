       If `G` is a multigraph, `keys` indicates whether the edge key `k` will
       be reported in the third position in the edge tuple. `data` indicates
       whether the edge datadict `d` will appear at the end of the edge tuple.

    Sample a random spanning tree using the edges weights of `G`.

    This function supports two different methods for determining the

    it is based on the sum of the edge weight. However, since it is
    easier to determine the total weight of all spanning trees for the
    multiplicative verison, that is significantly faster and should be used if
    possible. Additionally, setting `weight` to `None` will cause a spanning tree
    to be selected with uniform probability.

    weight : string

    multiplicative : bool, default=True
        If `True`, the probability of each tree is the product of its edge weight
        over the sum of the product of all the spanning trees in the graph. If
