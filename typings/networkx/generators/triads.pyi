def triad_graph(triad_name): # -> DiGraph:
    """Returns the triad graph with the given name.

    Each string in the following tuple is a valid triad name::

        ('003', '012', '102', '021D', '021U', '021C', '111D', '111U',
         '030T', '030C', '201', '120D', '120U', '120C', '210', '300')

    Each triad name corresponds to one of the possible valid digraph on
    three nodes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    triad_name : string
        The name of a triad, as described above.

    Returns
    -------
    :class:`~networkx.DiGraph`
        The digraph on three nodes with the given name. The nodes of the
        graph are the single-character strings 'a', 'b', and 'c'.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `triad_name` is not the name of a triad.
