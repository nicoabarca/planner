        Notes

        The process steps are the following: first we create the core network
        of tier one nodes, then we add the middle tier (M), the content
        provider (CP) and the customer (C) nodes along with their transit edges
        (link i,j means i is customer of j). Finally we add peering links
        between M nodes, between M and CP nodes and between CP node couples.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n: integer in [1000, 10000]
        Number of graph nodes
    seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)
        Indicator of random number generation state.

    Notes
    -----
    This algorithm returns an undirected graph resembling the Internet
    Autonomous System (AS) network, it uses the approach by Elmokashfi et al.
    [1]_ and it grants the properties described in the related paper [1]_.

    Each node models an autonomous system, with an attribute 'type' specifying
    its kind; tier-1 (T), mid-level (M), customer (C) or content-provider (CP).
    Each edge models an ADV communication link (hence, bidirectional) with
    attributes:

      - type: transit|peer, the kind of commercial agreement between nodes;
      - customer: <node id>, the identifier of the node acting as customer
        ('none' if type is peer).
